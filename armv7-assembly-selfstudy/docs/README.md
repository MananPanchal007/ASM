# ARMv7 Assembly Self-Study

Welcome to the ARMv7 Assembly Self-Study project! This repository is designed to help you learn ARMv7 assembly language programming, particularly in the context of the DE1 SoC platform. 

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each containing files that focus on different aspects of ARMv7 assembly language:

- **src/**: This directory contains the source code files written in ARMv7 assembly language.
  - **basics.s**: Basic assembly language instructions and examples.
  - **loops.s**: Examples of loop constructs in ARMv7 assembly.
  - **functions.s**: How to define and call functions in ARMv7 assembly.
  - **memory.s**: Memory management techniques in ARMv7 assembly.
  - **io.s**: Input and output operations in ARMv7 assembly.
  - **Makefile**: Automation of the build process for the assembly files.

- **docs/**: Documentation files providing an overview and additional resources.
  - **README.md**: Overview of the project.
  - **references.md**: Additional resources and tutorials for further study.

- **examples/**: Example programs demonstrating various concepts in ARMv7 assembly.
  - **add_numbers.s**: An example program that adds two numbers.
  - **factorial.s**: An example program that calculates the factorial of a number.
  - **fibonacci.s**: An example program that generates Fibonacci numbers.

## Getting Started

To get started with learning ARMv7 assembly language, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project to your local machine.
2. **Explore the Source Files**: Begin with the `basics.s` file to understand fundamental concepts.
3. **Build the Examples**: Use the provided Makefile to assemble the example programs.
4. **Experiment**: Modify the example programs and create your own to deepen your understanding.

## Additional Resources

For further study, refer to the `references.md` file in the `docs/` directory, which lists tutorials, documentation, and other helpful resources.

Happy learning!
