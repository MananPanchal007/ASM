# ARMv7 Assembly Self-Study

Welcome to the ARMv7 Assembly Self-Study project! This repository is designed to help you learn ARMv7 assembly language programming, particularly in the context of the DE1 SoC. 

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories:

- **src**: Contains the source code files written in ARMv7 assembly language.
  - `basics.s`: Basic assembly language instructions and examples.
  - `loops.s`: Examples of loop constructs in ARMv7 assembly.
  - `functions.s`: How to define and call functions in ARMv7 assembly.
  - `memory.s`: Memory management in ARMv7 assembly.
  - `io.s`: Input and output operations in ARMv7 assembly.
  - `Makefile`: Automates the build process for the assembly files.

- **docs**: Documentation files for the project.
  - `README.md`: Overview of the project and how to get started.
  - `references.md`: Additional resources for further study.

- **examples**: Example programs demonstrating various concepts in ARMv7 assembly.
  - `add_numbers.s`: Program that adds two numbers and outputs the result.
  - `factorial.s`: Program that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
  - `fibonacci.s`: Program that generates Fibonacci numbers.

## Getting Started

To get started with learning ARMv7 assembly language:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory and review the assembly files to understand the basic concepts.
3. Use the `Makefile` to assemble the source files and create executable binaries.
4. Explore the example programs in the `examples` directory to see practical applications of the concepts you've learned.
5. Refer to the `docs` directory for additional information and resources.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding more examples, improving documentation, or suggesting new topics to cover. 

Happy coding and learning!
